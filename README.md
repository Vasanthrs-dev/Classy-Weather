# Classy Weather App

A simple weather app built using React! This app fetches weather data from an API and displays it using React class components to practice and improve understanding of class-based components.

## Features

- **Weather Forecast**: Displays the weekly weather forecast.
- **Live Data**: Fetches real-time weather data from a public API.
- **Local Storage**: Remembers the last searched city. If the user searches for a city (e.g., "Chennai"), the app will retain that city even after the page is reloaded.
